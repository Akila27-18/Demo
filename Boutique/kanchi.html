    <h1>Kanchipattu - From the City of Thousand Temples</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Kanchipuram, one of the oldest cities of India traces its origin back to the Chola, Pallava & Vijayanagar dynasty during which many temples of the Dravidian architecture were built which paved way to its popularity as 'the city of thousand temples'.</p>
    <br>
        <p>The Dravidian temple architecture is an inspiration for many other art forms and also for the very famous Kanchipuram silk sarees. Our series is inspired from this beautiful land of temples.</p>
